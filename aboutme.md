# My Story
I worked in the UW Fish Collection from 2010-2014, after meeting Katherine at an incoming freshmen event and all but begging her to let me volunteer. My work in the collection led me to do my capstone research project on snailfish, trying to identify which species lay their eggs in king crabs. This work led to a publication which won Best Student Paper in Copeia for 2016.  I then took a three year hiatus from systematics and worked with Dave Beauchamp’s lab as part of the Washington Cooperative Fish and Wildlife Research Unit. I worked on multiple different projects in this lab focusing on food web ecology of lakes, reservoirs, and Puget Sound. When the time came to return to school I couldn’t pass up the opportunity to return to systematics. I am very excited to be part of the Tornabene lab and to be returning to the UW Fish Collection. My research is going to be on systematics of snailfish of the genus Careproctus. Additionally, I hope to do some research looking at snailfish eyeballs and potential novel evolutions within them. My hobbies outside of research include hiking, backpacking, dog sitting, and rock climbing.
